## Overview

This dashboard demonstrates how perception and weather data can be fused to aid safer, more resilient urban traversal. It uses:

- **YOLOv11** for detecting urban elements like vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.
- **Live weather feeds** to adjust routing dynamically based on conditions.
- **Real-time rerouting** that either penalises or blocks problematic road segments.
- A clean, user-friendly **HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface** for visual monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with adaptive responses to environmental changes.
- Dynamic route adjustment prioritising safety under adverse weather.
- Web-based display with room for expansion â€” ideal for research or demos.
